Birds are chirping, a cheerful song,
As a new day begins, it won't be long.
The world awakens from its nightly rest,
Nature puts on its morning best.
Dewdrops glisten on leaves so green,
A beautiful sight, like a dream.</h4>
<h4 className='rhyme'>Children rise with a sleepy yawn,
Greeted by a brand new dawn.
In pajamas, they shuffle and play,
Welcoming the start of a brand new day.</h4>


<h4 className='rhyme'>
Breakfast smells fill the kitchen air,
Pancakes flipping, a delightful affair.
School bags packed, shoes on feet,
The morning hustle can't be beat.
</h4>

<h4 className='rhyme'>So, in the early light so divine,
With sleepy eyes and a stretch, we shine.
A new adventure awaits, come what may,
In the magic of morning, let's seize the day!</h4>
